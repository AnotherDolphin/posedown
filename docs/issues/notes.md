- focus spans must mirror one/another's edits (must be identical) for inline els
- backspacing on `**bold**..` makes the marker go after b `*b|old..`
- must hide and override default LI html marker; bad UX when md FocusMarks delimiter is also displayed
- focusing on a list item should focus the end not the focus span
- live marks
